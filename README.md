This project is written by kayhan.kaynar@hotmail.com for using rpiplay instance as a Raspberry Pi AirPlay server.
When using rpiplay , sometimes when you connect to the service, rpiplay instance gets null buffer error
and then crashes with some video,audio problems. This script is written to fix the problem with an innovative perspective.
The script detects  if a client is connected, and if the client disconnects because of a sound or smt else problem, 
script detects it and then restarts the rpiplay instance.
For RPiPlay setup and usage:
RPiPlay : https://github.com/FD-/RPiPlay.git
